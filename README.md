RESTful WebService written in Scala using Play! Framework. The DataBase used has finally been the virtual DB of the framework,
H2. I tried with MySQL and PostgresSQL but due to being totally new to Scala and Play and the few documentation I found
I was not able to pull it out. Good think is now it should work out of the box :D Just follow this steps in case you are not familiar with 
the framework:     
    - Download the code         
    - run "./activator run" in the root of the project    
    - Browse the service through you desired browser    
    - First time you enter you will be asked to accept running a SQL query to create the table    
    - After accepting that you should be able to make the basic operations on cars    

Again, I first touched Scala and Play! two days ago, but I think I've put a decent fight. All constructive criticism accepted. Regards!
